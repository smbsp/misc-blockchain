## Introduction

This repository showcases a variety of projects related to different aspects of blockchain technology. Each project focuses on a specific area, such as the Metaverse, NFTs, Marketplaces, Safe Contracts, and the Polygon Chain, demonstrating different concepts and techniques used in blockchain development.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/smbsp/misc-blockchain.git
    cd misc-blockchain
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, then run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile the contracts**:
    Use Hardhat to compile the smart contracts:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. **Run tests**:
    Execute the tests to verify the implementations:
    ```sh
    npx hardhat test
    ```

## Projects

### Metaverse

The Metaverse represents a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual spaces. It includes virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.

- **Metaverse Implementation**: [Metaverse.sol](./contracts/Metaverse.sol)
- **Test File**: [Metaverse.test.js](./test/Metaverse.test.js)

### NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content, verified through blockchain technology.

- **NFT Implementation**: [NFT.sol](./contracts/NFT.sol)
- **Test File**: [NFT.test.js](./test/NFT.test.js)

### Marketplaces

Marketplaces in the blockchain context refer to decentralized platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade digital assets such as NFTs.

- **Marketplace Implementation**: [Marketplace.sol](./contracts/Marketplace.sol)
- **Test File**: [Marketplace.test.js](./test/Marketplace.test.js)

### Polygon Chain

Polygon (formerly Matic Network) is a protocol and framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. It aims to address some of Ethereum's major limitations, including its throughput, poor user experience, and lack of community governance.

- **Polygon Chain Integration**: [PolygonIntegration.sol](./contracts/PolygonIntegration.sol)
- **Test File**: [PolygonIntegration.test.js](./test/PolygonIntegration.test.js)
