## Final Project

* Create a collectible contract using ERC721 standard
* Each NFT minted should be assigned token strength via a random number generated using Chainlink's VRF. (Use VRF Coordinator and Link token address for the one available on mumbai testnet)
* The contract shall be deployed to the Polygon network
* Create some sample NFT artworks off-chain and deploy it to IPFS.
* Create a frontend that connects to deployed smart contract and displays all deployed NFTs from IPFS.
* Add a mint button beneath each artwork which when clicked calls  `mint` function of the collectible contract.
